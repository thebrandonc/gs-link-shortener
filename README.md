## Simple Link Shortener Script for Google Sheets

This repo contains a simple script you can paste into your App Scripts editor to add a basic link shortener feature to Google Sheets. The script calls a free 3rd party API to provide the link shortening functionality.

This script was produced as part of a tutorial we posted to Youtube: [Check out the Tutorial](https://youtu.be/R7T20_nlvbk)

## Getting Started

To use this script you will first need to create a free account at [UrlBae](https://urlbae.com/user/register). Once the account is created, simply paste the script into your App Scripts editor and replace the `apiKey` value with your own key. Run the script by clicking "Run" in your Editor, or set up a trigger to run the script after certain events.
